The modern borders of Israel exist as the result both of past wars and of diplomatic agreements between the State of Israel and its neighbours, as well as an effect of the agreements among colonial powers ruling in the region before Israel's creation. Only two of Israel's five total potential land borders are internationally recognized and uncontested, while the other three remain disputed; the majority of its border disputes are rooted in territorial changes that came about as a result of the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, which saw Israel occupy large swathes of territory from its rivals. Further, Israel has not officially defined its own borders.
Israel's two formally recognized and confirmed borders exist with Egypt and Jordan since the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty and the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, while its borders with Syria (via the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights), Lebanon (via the Blue Line; see Shebaa Farms dispute) and the Palestinian territories (Israeli-occupied land largely recognized as part of the de jure State of Palestine) remain internationally defined as contested.According to the Green Line agreed upon in the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Israel is demarcated by Lebanon to the north, the Golan Heights under Syrian sovereignty as well as the rest of Syria to the northeast, the Palestinian West Bank and Jordan to the east, and by the Palestinian Gaza Strip and Egypt to the southwest. The Israeli border with Egypt is the international border demarcated in 1906 between the United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire, and confirmed in the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty; the Israeli border with Jordan is based on the border defined in the 1922 Trans-Jordan memorandum, and confirmed in the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty.

<doc id="13590385" title="Brazil–Colombia border">
The border between Brazil and Colombia is 1,644.2 km (1,021.7 mi) long. The boundary was delimited in two treaties:

the Vásquez Cobo-Martins treaty of 1907, establishing the line from the Rio Negro northwestward along the Amazon River-Orinoco watershed divide, "then generally southward along various river courses and straight-line segments to the mouth of the Apaporis River", and
the Tratado de Límites y Navegación Fluvial of 1928, delimiting the Apaporis-Amazon segment of the boundary as a "geodesic line identical to its Brazilian-Peruvian antecedent after Colombia gained undisputed sovereignty over the area".

<doc id="47360834" title="Brazil–Uruguay border">
The Brazil–Uruguay border is a strip of land located south of the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. It stretches for 985 km from the triple border Brazil-Argentina-Uruguay west to the mouth of Arroyo Chuí, the southernmost point in Brazil.The western section of the border is marked by Quaraí River, a tributary of the Uruguay River and the "coxilhas of Santana." To the east, its border is marked by the Jaguarão River that flows into the Lagoa Mirim. The border then runs from southern portion of this lagoon to the Chui.There are two disputed areas on the border between Brazil and Uruguay, which were the Brazilian Island and the Corner of Artigas (interfluve between the Quaraí River and the Arroyo Invernada). The two areas are administered by Brazil, yet are claimed for decades by Uruguay.

<doc id="47426457" title="Brazil–Venezuela border">
The Brazil–Venezuela border is the limit that separates the territories of Brazil and Venezuela. It was delimited by the Treaty of Limits and River Navigation of May 5, 1859 and ratified by the Protocol of 1929. The geographical boundary begins at the triple point between Brazil-Colombia-Venezuela at Cucuy Rock and continues up the Maturacá channel to the Huá waterfall; it then follows a straight line to the top of a mountain called Cerro Cupi. It then follows the crest of the drainage divide between the Orinoco and Amazon river basins up to the Brazil-Guyana-Venezuela border tripoint on top of Mount Roraima, thus covering a total of 2,199 kilometres (of which 90 km are conventional boundaries and the other 2,109 km correspond to the watershed between the basins of the Amazon (Brazil) and Orinoco (Venezuela)) through the Imeri, Tapirapecó, Curupira and Urucuzeiro mountain ranges (Brazilian state of Amazonas), and the Parima, Auari, Urutanim and Pacaraima ranges (State of Roraima), in the Guiana Shield.Historically, Brazil and Venezuela have both made land claims for the western portion of Guyana, referred to as the Guayana Esequiba by Venezuela. The tributaries of the Amazon that extend into Guyana were claimed by Brazil but this was settled during the Pirara arbitration in 1904. The Venezuelan claim to the area is not officially recognized by Brazil, and Guyana exerts effective control over the disputed region.
The internationally recognized border is mostly located in remote and inaccessible wilderness areas, and it has only one road crossing, between the towns of Pacaraima (Brazil) and Santa Elena de Uairén (Venezuela), where the Brazilian BR-174 federal highway from Boa Vista and Manaus joins the Venezuelan Troncal 10 from Ciudad Guayana and Caracas.

<doc id="17319229" title="Brunei–Malaysia border">
The Brunei–Malaysia border divides the territory of Brunei and Malaysia on the island of Borneo. It consists of a 266 km (165 mi) land border and substantial lengths of maritime borders stretching from the coastline of the two countries to the edge of the continental shelf in the South China Sea.Brunei's 200 nautical mile continental shelf claim makes it a claimant of a portion of the South China Sea that is subject to multiple overlapping claims by China, Taiwan and Vietnam. Malaysia is also a claimant in the area but a bilateral agreement with Brunei has solved the overlapping claims over Brunei's territorial waters.

<doc id="54989143" title="Bulgaria–Romania border">
The Bulgaria–Romania border (Bulgarian: Граница между България и Румъния, romanized: Granitsa mezhdu Bŭlgariya i Rumŭniya, Romanian: Graniță între Bulgaria și România) is the state border between Bulgaria and Romania.
For most of its length, the border follows the course of the lower Danube, up until the town of Silistra. From Silistra, the river continues north into the Romanian territory. East of that point, the land border passes through the historical region of Dobruja, dividing it into Northern Dobruja in Romania and Southern Dobruja in Bulgaria.
The Bulgaria–Romania border is an internal border of the European Union. However, as of 2024 neither country is part of the Schengen Area. As a result, border controls are conducted between the two countries, albeit often jointly (once per crossing).

<doc id="49431870" title="Bulgaria–Turkey border">
The Bulgaria–Turkey border (Bulgarian: Българо-турска граница, romanized: Būlgaro-turska granitsa,Turkish: Bulgaristan–Türkiye sınırı) is a 513 km (319 mi) long international border between the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Turkey. It was established by the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 as an inner border within the Ottoman Empire between Adrianople Vilayet and the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia. The current borders are defined by the Treaty of Constantinople (1913) and the Bulgarian–Ottoman convention (1915). The border was reaffirmed by the Treaty of Lausanne ten years later, though Bulgaria was not a party to the latter treaty as it had earlier ceded to Greece that part of its border with Turkey which was modified by the Bulgarian-Ottoman convention.
